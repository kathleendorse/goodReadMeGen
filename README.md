  ## Description
  This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional READ.md from a user's input using the node Inquirer package. The general format ensures all basic requirements for a good README.md file are met. In order to serve dual purposes, I have used the application to generate the README.md for this project so it also serves as a "sample".  The only change made to this README.md after the fact/outside of the application- will be the addition of the walkthrough video demonstrating the application's functionality.  This must be added after the fact because it is being recorded simultaneously.

  ## Installation
  To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

  `
  npm install
  `

  ## Usage
  Information left blank will be missing from the generated file but can be added/altered after the fact.  Because of the standard README.MD title name used while writing the file, you may encounter difficulties writing multiple files in the same directory with duplicate names. You will receive a console.log on the command line once the prompts are complete indicating either that your README.md file was successfully created or an error.
